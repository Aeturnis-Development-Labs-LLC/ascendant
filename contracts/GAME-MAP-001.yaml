priority: high
description: Implement the Floor class for procedural dungeon generation

expected_behavior:
  - Floor class in src/models/floor.py
  - 20x20 grid of Tile objects
  - Seed parameter for reproducible generation
  - generate() method that creates rooms
  - Random seed produces identical layouts
  - Grid stored as 2D list or dict

success_criteria:
  - Floor class can be instantiated with seed
  - generate() method creates valid floor layout
  - Same seed always produces same layout
  - All tiles in grid are properly initialized
  - Floor boundaries are walls

dependencies:
  - GAME-CORE-003 (Tile data structure)

validation:
  - Tests verify floor generation
  - Tests confirm seed reproducibility
  - Tests check grid dimensions
  - Tests verify all tiles are valid
