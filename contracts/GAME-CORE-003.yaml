description: Implement the Tile class representing a single map position

expected_behavior:
  - Tile has immutable position (x, y) set at creation
  - Has tile_type property using TileType enum
  - Can hold optional occupant (Entity)
  - Can hold optional item (Item)
  - Provides is_walkable property based on tile type
  - Validates single occupancy (prevents multiple entities)
  - FLOOR and STAIRS_UP tiles are walkable
  - WALL, TRAP, and CHEST tiles are not walkable by default

success_criteria:
  - Tile class defined in src/models/tile.py
  - Position is immutable after creation
  - Proper validation prevents multiple occupants
  - is_walkable property works correctly
  - Type hints for all attributes
  - Proper error handling for invalid operations

dependencies:
  - GAME-CORE-002 (for TileType enum)

validation:
  - Tests verify position immutability
  - Tests confirm occupancy validation
  - Tests verify walkability logic
  - Tests confirm item placement
