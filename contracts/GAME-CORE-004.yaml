name: Entity Base Class
category: core
priority: high
description: Implement the Entity abstract base class for all game entities

expected_behavior:
  - Entity has immutable position tuple (x, y)
  - Has unique entity_id (UUID string)
  - Has entity_type using EntityType enum
  - Defines abstract update() method
  - Defines abstract render() method
  - Position cannot be changed after creation
  - Entity ID is automatically generated if not provided

success_criteria:
  - Entity class defined in src/models/entity.py
  - Class is abstract (cannot be instantiated directly)
  - Position is immutable
  - UUID generation works correctly
  - Abstract methods are properly defined
  - Type hints for all attributes and methods

dependencies:
  - GAME-CORE-002 (for EntityType enum)

validation:
  - Tests verify Entity cannot be instantiated directly
  - Tests confirm position immutability
  - Tests verify UUID uniqueness
  - Tests confirm subclasses must implement abstract methods
