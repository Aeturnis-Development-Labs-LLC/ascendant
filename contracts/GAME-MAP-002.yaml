name: Room Generation Algorithm
category: map-generation
priority: high
description: Implement basic rectangular room generation within floors

expected_behavior:
  - Generate 5-10 rectangular rooms per floor
  - Room size between 3x3 and 8x8 tiles
  - Rooms cannot overlap
  - Rooms must be at least 1 tile from edges
  - Non-room tiles are walls
  - Rooms have floor tiles

success_criteria:
  - Algorithm generates correct number of rooms
  - All rooms within size constraints
  - No room overlaps detected
  - Edge clearance maintained
  - Room interiors are FLOOR tiles
  - Room count varies with different seeds

dependencies:
  - GAME-MAP-001 (Floor generation system)
  - GAME-CORE-003 (Tile data structure)

validation:
  - Tests verify room count range
  - Tests check room dimensions
  - Tests ensure no overlaps
  - Tests verify edge clearance
  - Tests confirm room tile types
