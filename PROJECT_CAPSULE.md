# Project Capsule: Ascendant - The Eternal Spire

**Version**: 0.14.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-23  
**Status**: Alpha - Basic Client UI Complete

## Executive Summary

Ascendant: The Eternal Spire is a roguelike dungeon crawler focused on ascending an infinite tower. The project now features a complete PyQt6-based client with map display, zoom/minimap functionality, and comprehensive information panels for character status, inventory, and game messages.

## Current State

### Codebase Statistics
- **Total Lines**: ~4,200 (including new UI components)
- **Test Coverage**: 92.56%
- **Tests**: 360 (all passing)
- **Python Version**: 3.11+
- **UI Framework**: PyQt6

### Recent Changes (v0.14.0)
- Implemented complete PyQt6 client with three-panel layout
- Added MapWidget with zoom (0.5x-3.0x) and minimap overlay
- Created CharacterPanel with HP/stamina bars, stats, and action slots
- Built InfoPanel with tabs for inventory, combat log, and statistics
- Developed StatusBar with priority-based messaging system
- Integrated all panels with real-time synchronization

## Architecture Overview

### Core Systems Implemented

#### 1. Data Models (`src/models/`)
- **Character**: Player/NPC representation with position and stamina
- **Floor**: 20x20 dungeon floor with room generation
- **Tile**: Individual map tiles with type and occupancy
- **Item**: Base item system (partially implemented)
- **Location**: World map locations and dungeons
- **WorldMap**: 10x10 overworld with terrain types
- **SafeHaven**: Special hub location

#### 2. Game Systems (`src/game/`)
- **Movement**: Simple movement functions with collision detection
- **Stamina**: Action cost and regeneration system
- **Environmental Hazards**: Weather and terrain effects
- **Fast Travel**: Carriage system for world navigation
- **Escape Mechanics**: Rope-based dungeon escape
- **Dungeon Properties**: Level scaling and configuration
- **Random Encounters**: Terrain-based enemy spawning
- **Location Actions**: Context-sensitive interactions

#### 3. Rendering (`src/renderers/`)
- **ASCII Renderer**: Console-based floor visualization with fog of war
- **World Map Renderer**: Overworld display with weather
- **Color System**: RGB/ANSI colors with accessibility features

#### 4. Input (`src/input/`)
- **Keyboard Handler**: WASD movement input (integrated with MainWindow)

#### 5. Client UI (`client/`)
- **MainWindow**: Three-panel layout with menu system
- **MapWidget**: Tile-based map display with zoom and minimap
- **CharacterPanel**: Character info, HP/stamina, stats, buffs/debuffs
- **InfoPanel**: Tabbed interface for inventory, combat log, statistics
- **StatusBar**: Priority-based message system with auto-clear

### Implementation Status

#### Fully Implemented ✅
- Project structure and tooling
- Core data models (Floor, Room, Tile, Character)
- Floor generation with rooms and corridors
- Stairs placement and connectivity
- ASCII visualization with fog of war
- Movement system with collision
- Stamina system with action costs
- World map with terrain types
- Color system with accessibility
- PyQt6 client with three-panel layout
- Map display with zoom and minimap
- Character information panel
- Tabbed info panel (inventory, combat log, stats)
- Priority-based status messages

#### Partially Implemented 🟡
- Item system (base class only)
- Safe Haven (structure complete, no interactions)
- Environmental hazards (logic complete, not integrated)
- Fast travel (system complete, not integrated)

#### Not Integrated ❌
- Main game loop (UI exists but no game logic)
- Save/load system
- Combat system
- Inventory management (UI exists but no items)
- NPCs and dialogue
- Sound system

## Known Issues & Debt

### Technical Debt
1. **No Game Logic Integration**: UI exists but game systems not connected
2. **Mock Data**: Demo uses hardcoded data instead of real game state
3. **No State Management**: No save/load or game state tracking
4. **Limited Panel Interactions**: Panels display but don't affect gameplay

### Architectural Decisions
- **No Entity Inheritance**: Characters directly implement properties
- **Functions Over Classes**: Static classes converted to modules
- **Minimal Abstraction**: Direct implementation preferred

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Integrate game logic with UI (connect movement, stamina, floor systems)
2. Implement game state management
3. Create item system and connect to inventory UI
4. Implement save/load functionality

### Medium Priority
1. Combat system implementation
2. Item and inventory management
3. NPC interactions
4. Quest/achievement system

### Low Priority
1. Sound system
2. Particle effects
3. Mod support
4. Multiplayer

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Functions over static classes
- Direct implementation over abstraction
- Test coverage must stay above 90%
- All new features need UTF contracts

### Testing Strategy
- TDD for new features
- Minimum 90% coverage
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Integration tests for game systems

## Performance Targets
- Floor generation: <100ms
- Movement processing: <10ms
- Rendering frame: <20ms
- Save/load: <500ms
