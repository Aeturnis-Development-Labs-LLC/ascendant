# Phase 2.3 World Map System - Audit Report

## Implementation Summary

Phase 2.3 has successfully implemented the core world map system, providing the foundational overworld navigation structure needed for players to traverse between locations.

## Implemented Components

### 1. World Map Generation (WorldMap class)
- ✅ 75x75 grid world map
- ✅ Multiple terrain types: Plains, Forest, Mountains, Water, Roads, Shadowlands
- ✅ Procedural terrain generation with seed support
- ✅ Safe Haven placement at center (37, 37)
- ✅ Road network from Safe Haven

### 2. Location System (Location hierarchy)
- ✅ Base Location abstract class
- ✅ SafeHaven implementation
  - Always discovered
  - No combat zone
  - Can create interior floor layout
- ✅ DungeonEntrance implementation
  - Level bracketed access (1-9, 10-19, etc.)
  - Floor count per dungeon
  - Completion tracking
- ✅ TowerEntrance implementation
  - Level 10+ requirement
  - Must complete 1+ dungeons
  - Adjacent to Safe Haven

### 3. Navigation System (WorldNavigation class)
- ✅ Movement cost by terrain
- ✅ Vision radius by terrain
- ✅ Location discovery mechanics
- ✅ Distance calculations (Euclidean and Manhattan)
- ✅ Entry validation for locations

### 4. Location Manager (LocationManager class)
- ✅ Places all locations at correct positions
- ✅ Manages dungeon level brackets
- ✅ Finds locations by position
- ✅ Filters accessible dungeons by level
- ✅ Nearest location search

## Test Coverage

All components have comprehensive test coverage:
- `test_world_map.py`: 13 tests covering world generation
- `test_locations.py`: 12 tests covering all location types
- `test_world_navigation.py`: 10 tests covering navigation
- `test_location_manager.py`: 10 tests covering location management

Total: 45 tests, all passing

## UTF Contract Compliance

The following UTF contracts were implemented:
- GAME-MAP-001: World Map Generation ✅
- GAME-MAP-002: Safe Haven Location ✅
- GAME-MAP-003: Dungeon Placement ✅
- GAME-MAP-004: Tower Placement ✅
- GAME-MAP-005: Movement System ✅
- GAME-MAP-006: Fog of War (partially - discovery tracking) ⚠️
- GAME-MAP-007: Fast Travel (not implemented) ❌
- GAME-MAP-008: Escape Rope (not implemented) ❌
- GAME-MAP-009: Carriage Travel (not implemented) ❌
- GAME-MAP-010: Soul Badges (not implemented) ❌
- GAME-MAP-011: Corpse Placement (not implemented) ❌
- GAME-MAP-012: Safe Haven Interior (partial - floor creation) ⚠️
- GAME-MAP-013: Tower Entry Requirements ✅

## Quality Checks

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Flake8 compliance (no issues in new code)
- ✅ MyPy type checking (minor suppressions needed)
- ✅ Black formatting applied
- ✅ isort import sorting applied

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Fixed World Size**: 75x75 provides adequate space without being overwhelming
2. **Center Placement**: Safe Haven at exact center (37, 37) for easy navigation
3. **Tower Adjacent**: Tower at (37, 36) makes it discoverable but distinct
4. **Level Brackets**: Clear 10-level brackets for dungeons
5. **Terrain Movement**: Logical movement costs (roads fastest, mountains slowest)

## Phase 2.3 Status: COMPLETE

### What's Next

Phase 2.4 should implement:
- World map rendering with color
- Player movement on world map
- Fog of war visualization
- Location entry/exit mechanics
- Fast travel systems (walking and carriage)

## Technical Debt

1. The `tile.location` attribute needs proper typing in WorldTile
2. Some UTF contracts are only partially implemented
3. Interior generation for locations needs more detail
4. No save/load functionality for world state

## Recommendations

1. Implement Phase 2.4 next to add player interaction with the world map
2. Add color rendering in Phase 2.6 for better visual distinction
3. Consider adding more location types (villages) post-MVP
4. Implement save/load for world discovery state
